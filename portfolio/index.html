			<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
			<img src="images/selfie.jpg" alt="Self portrait of Michael"/>
			<p>I am a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University, but I have attended a number of colleges and universities before finally getting my degree. I have studied multiple aspects of Computer Science and Mathematics, until I turned my focus onto the Computer Gaming aspect of programming. The high-level languages that I have been focused on have been C#, C++, ASP.NET, and Java but I have also worked with other languages, particularly HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Through learning these languages, I became increasingly familiar with programs such as Visual Studio, Netbeans IDE, Brackets as well as Adobe Dreamweaver. In addition to the programs used in development, practices such as Scrum/Agile as well as Source Control with Git and Bitbucket were core to my overall curriculum.</p>

			<p>I currently reside in the Greater Milwaukee Area, but that was not always so. I was originally from New England, New Hampshire and Upper Massachusetts in particular. I have two sons, one was diagnosed with Autism, and so everything that I do, I do for them. Their names are Ayden (4) and Ezio (18 months). While my primary focus was on the programming languages and practices involved in the SDLC, I was exposed to other elements in the game design process, such as level design, narrative writing, 2D animation (scripting in HTML5 and design), 3D modeling as well as texturing said models. </p>
