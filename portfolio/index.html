	<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
	<p>I am a recent graduate from Southern New Hampshire University, but I have attended a number of colleges and universities before finally getting my degree. I have studied multiple aspects of Computer Science and Mathematics, until I turned my focus onto the Computer Gaming aspect of programming. The high-level languages that I have been focused on have been C#, C++, ASP.NET, and Java but I have also worked with other languages, particularly HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Through learning these languages, I became increasingly familiar with programs such as Visual Studio, Netbeans IDE, Brackets as well as Adobe Dreamweaver. In addition to the programs used in development, practices such as Scrum/Agile as well as Source Control with Git and Bitbucket were core to my overall curriculum.</p>
	
	<p>I currently reside in the Greater Milwaukee Area, but that was not always so. I was originally from New England, New Hampshire and Upper Massachusetts in particular. I have two sons, one was diagnosed with Autism, and so everything that I do, I do for them. Their names are Ayden (4) and Ezio (18 months). While my primary focus was on the programming languages and practices involved in the SDLC, I was exposed to other elements in the game design process, such as level design, narrative writing, 2D animation (scripting in HTML5 and design), 3D modeling as well as texturing said models. </p>
	
	<h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
	<p>During my time at Milwaukee Area Technical College(MATC) and Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), there were several instances of team-based projects focused on developing a familiarity with the Scrum and Agile curriculum. Using the Scrum and Agile as well as following the Software Development Life Cycle, we were tasked with creating a game project that would be ready to be packaged and shipped to various platforms. My first such game came in the form of a game called <i>"Alternalien"</i> <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/games/peck2703/alternalien-demo">(link to the game here)</a>, in which players take control of various aliens that were captured and locked up in Area 51, and are tasked with solving various puzzles in order to escape. This game was created using the Unity3D engine and with the C# language, and then it was shipped and uploaded to the flash game website, called <a href="http://www.Kongregate.com/">Kongregate.com</a>.</p>
	<p>When I finally transferred to my last university, I had to learn the industry standard game engine, which was the Unreal 4 Engine, of which I had limited practice before enrolling. But coming off of working with the Unity3D engine extensively, it became easier with the curriculum that was designed for each project. One such particular team-based project, we were tasked with creating a small game that required a minimum of 4 common game mechanics which originated an instructor-created list, such as elevators, teleporters, replication, mini-map overlay, etc. Working on this project, we were allowed to choose our roles in development. Being that I had previous leadership experience, I was chosed as the team leader, as well as my chosen role as the lead designer, such as the overall level design, rather than take on a programming role. Our team worked tirelessly for four (4) weeks and our instructor was impressed with the overall design of the game, and even made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC6VQmyuWec&feature=youtu.be">reaction video</a> while playing our game.</p>
	
	<h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
	<p>One of my biggest and most time-consuming hobbies is video games: both playing and developing. I am currently in development with two (2) different types of games, both of which will be categorized under the <i>"Indie"</i> category. My first game is a first-person horror adventure game with a touch of murder-mystery embedded in the plot, while the other is still in the initial design phase, but will be a bit of a throwback to retro gaming, featuring side scrolling action, couch co-op play and many more. Most of the work will be completed by a small team, or perhaps solo. It is all dependant on how the Unreal Marketplace sells various assets necessary for the game. When it comes to gaming, I do not discriminate between platforms. I play on multiple platforms, and play many genres. My favorite genres are Role-Playing, such as the Final Fantasy series, Action-Adventure, such as Horizon: Zero Dawn and Deus Ex, and many more. I currently do not have a favorite platform, but I do play on the Xbox, PlayStation as well as the Nintendo Switch.</p>
	<p>My other hobbies include reading fiction novels, mostly associated with fantasy worlds. My favorite series currently are the Legend of Drizzt by R.A. Salvatore, The Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind and just about everything written by techno-thriller author Michael Chrichton. I also love to cook, grill and bake, and I have spent the last couple of years trying new recipes, including some of my own, and modifying existing ones, but it's especially hard when you have kids who are extremely picky eaters. I also love to mess around with PC building and upgrading various components.</p>
